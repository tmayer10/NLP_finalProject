2.  Manage your project dependencies with `poetry`
3.  Test your API's functionality using `pytest`
4.  Create a `Dockerfile` which uses multi-stage builds to package and
    run your application
5.  Document your work with a `README.md` for how to build, run, and
    test code in the app root directory.
6.  Answer several short answer questions (2-3 sentences) to help

## Methodology {#methodology}

### Preprocessing {#preprocessing}

We will be utilizing GitHub Classroom to distribute, automatically
grade, and provide feedback on your assignments.

### Python Dependency Management: Poetry {#python-dependency-management-poetry}

Throughout the class, we will follow the opinionated structure that is
put together by the [python poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) package.
You will need to install this tool on your machine by [following the
instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). Make sure
to **follow all instructions, including adding poetry to your PATH**.

It's best not to use other `python` management systems simultaneously
(i.e., do not activate an anaconda environment and then create a poetry
environment within the other).

Poetry is intended to manage any external packages which you may use for
your application. [Check out the documentation for more
tips.](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/)


This will run the [uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) application within
the context of the virtual environment created by poetry without having
to source/activate the environment.
